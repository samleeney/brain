# Practical Applications

Real-world machine learning applications I discovered yesterday, connecting [[machine-learning-fundamentals]] and [[neural-networks]].

## Industry Examples I Researched

### Healthcare
What I learned about ML in medicine:
- **Medical Imaging**: Neural networks detecting tumors in X-rays
- **Drug Discovery**: ML accelerating pharmaceutical research  
- **Personalized Treatment**: Algorithms tailoring therapy to patients

```python
# Example: Medical image classification I studied
from tensorflow.keras import models, layers

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Binary: tumor/no tumor
])
```

### Finance
Applications that fascinated me:
- **Fraud Detection**: Real-time transaction monitoring
- **Algorithmic Trading**: ML models making investment decisions
- **Credit Scoring**: Automated loan approval systems

### Technology
Everyday ML I use without realizing:
- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix, Spotify, Amazon
- **Search Engines**: Google's ranking algorithms
- **Voice Assistants**: Siri, Alexa speech recognition

## Personal Projects I Want to Try

### Sentiment Analysis
Analyzing movie reviews or tweets:
```python
# Simple sentiment classifier idea
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

# Transform text to features
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(reviews)

# Train classifier
classifier = MultinomialNB()
classifier.fit(X, sentiments)
```

### Image Classifier
Building a cat vs dog detector like I studied in [[neural-networks]].

## What I'm Planning to Learn Next

- **Computer Vision**: Image processing and recognition
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding human language
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Teaching AI through rewards

## Connections to My Studies

- Built on [[machine-learning-fundamentals]] - the theory I needed first
- Uses [[neural-networks]] - the architecture powering modern AI
- Complements [[clustering-techniques]] - unsupervised methods have uses too
