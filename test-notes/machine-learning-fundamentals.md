# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Yesterday I learned about the core concepts that form the foundation of machine learning.

## What I Discovered

Machine learning is essentially about teaching computers to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for each task.

## Key Learnings

- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to train models, like the email spam classifier I studied
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data - see [[clustering-techniques]] for more
- **Feature Engineering**: The process of selecting and transforming variables for models

## Types of Problems

```python
# Example: Simple linear regression I implemented
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Training a model to predict house prices
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Next Steps

I want to dive deeper into:
- [[neural-networks]] - The brain-inspired approach I'm curious about  
- [[practical-applications]] - Real-world ML use cases

## Reflection

Understanding these fundamentals is crucial before moving to more complex topics like deep learning.
