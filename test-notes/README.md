# Machine Learning Study Notes

This directory contains test notes for the Brain MCP server, written as a machine learning knowledge base.

## Structure

- `machine-learning-fundamentals.md` - Core ML concepts and learning journey
- `clustering-techniques.md` - Unsupervised learning methods (K-means, etc.)
- `neural-networks.md` - Deep learning architectures and training
- `practical-applications.md` - Real-world ML use cases and project ideas

## Example Queries

These notes support queries like:
- "What did I learn about neural networks the other day?"
- "Show me clustering techniques I studied"
- "What are practical applications of machine learning?"
- "How does backpropagation work?"

## Usage in Tests

These notes are used to:
1. Test graph building with interconnected ML topics
2. Verify semantic search on technical content
3. Validate wiki-style link resolution between concepts
4. Test MCP server responses with realistic knowledge base content

## Linking Pattern

All notes are interconnected using wiki-style links (`[[note-name]]`) to create a realistic machine learning knowledge graph, simulating how someone might connect related concepts while learning.
