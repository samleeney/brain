# Brain - Knowledge Base Navigation Tool for LLMs

Brain is a command-line tool designed to help Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently navigate and understand markdown-based knowledge bases. It parses markdown files, builds a graph of connections between notes, and provides a search interface optimized for LLM consumption.

## ü§ñ Quick Start for Claude Code

**For Claude Code users:** Brain allows you to give Claude intelligent access to your markdown notes. Here's how to get started:

### 1. Install Brain
```bash
# Claude can run this command for you
npm install -g brain
```

### 2. Tell Claude about your notes
```
Claude, I have my notes stored in ~/vault. Use the brain tool to explore them:

brain --notes-root ~/vault overview
```

### 3. Ask Claude to search and analyze
```
Claude, find all my notes about machine learning:
brain --notes-root ~/vault search "machine learning"

Then read the most relevant one:
brain --notes-root ~/vault read [note-path-from-search]
```

### 4. Let Claude navigate relationships
```
Claude, show me what's related to my project-ideas note:
brain --notes-root ~/vault related project-ideas.md

And trace how my ideas connect to my implementations:
brain --notes-root ~/vault trace ideas.md implementation.md
```

## üéØ Key Commands for LLM Agents

### Essential Navigation
```bash
# Get complete knowledge base overview - START HERE
brain --notes-root ~/notes overview

# Search across all content, filenames, tags
brain --notes-root ~/notes search "your query"

# Read specific note with full context and connections
brain --notes-root ~/notes read note-name.md

# List notes in directory structure
brain --notes-root ~/notes ls [optional-path]
```

### Advanced Discovery
```bash
# Find related notes (direct links, clusters, similar topics)
brain --notes-root ~/notes related note-name.md

# Trace connection paths between any two notes
brain --notes-root ~/notes trace source.md target.md

# Pattern-based file finding
brain --notes-root ~/notes glob "**/*pattern*.md"

# Regex content search
brain --notes-root ~/notes grep "regex-pattern"
```

## ‚ú® Features

- **üîó Dual Organization**: Understands both hierarchical folders and graph-based wiki-style links
- **üîç Multi-Strategy Search**: Text content, filenames, tags, and graph navigation
- **ü§ñ LLM-Optimized**: Dense, structured output designed for efficient token usage
- **üìä Graph Analysis**: Detects hubs, clusters, orphaned notes, and connection paths

- **üîÑ Live Updates**: Incremental updates when files change

## üí° Why Brain + Claude Code?

Brain transforms how Claude Code can work with your knowledge base:

- **üéØ Contextual Understanding**: Instead of reading files one by one, Claude gets the full relationship map
- **üîç Intelligent Search**: Claude can find exactly what it needs across your entire knowledge base
- **üß† Graph Navigation**: Claude understands how your ideas connect and can trace thought processes
- **‚ö° Efficient Token Usage**: Dense, structured output minimizes context consumption
- **üîÑ Real-time Discovery**: Claude can explore relationships and discover relevant notes dynamically

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# LLM agents can run this directly
npm install -g brain

# Or use without installation
npx brain --notes-root ~/notes overview
```

## üìã Usage Patterns for LLM Agents

### Pattern 1: Knowledge Base Exploration
```bash
# 1. Start with overview to understand structure
brain --notes-root ~/vault overview

# 2. Search for specific topics
brain --notes-root ~/vault search "topic"

# 3. Read relevant notes with full context
brain --notes-root ~/vault read [found-note.md]

# 4. Explore connections
brain --notes-root ~/vault related [found-note.md]
```

### Pattern 2: Research Assistance
```bash
# Find all notes on a research topic
brain --notes-root ~/vault search "research query"

# Trace how concepts developed over time
brain --notes-root ~/vault trace initial-idea.md final-paper.md

# Find related research and references
brain --notes-root ~/vault related research-topic.md
```

### Pattern 3: Project Context Building
```bash
# Get project overview
brain --notes-root ~/vault glob "**/project-name*.md"

# Find project-related notes
brain --notes-root ~/vault search "project-name"

# Understand project connections
brain --notes-root ~/vault related project-main.md
```

## üîß Cache Management

Brain uses intelligent caching for performance. LLM agents should know:

```bash
# Check cache status
brain --notes-root ~/notes cache stats

# Rebuild if notes have changed significantly
brain --notes-root ~/notes cache rebuild

# Clear cache if having issues
brain --notes-root ~/notes cache clear
```

## üìù Supported Markdown

### Link Types
- **Wiki links**: `[[note-name]]` or `[[note-name|display text]]`
- **Markdown links**: `[display text](relative/path/to/note.md)`
- **Tags**: `#tag-name` anywhere in the document

### Document Structure
- **Headings**: All levels (`#` to `######`) for hierarchy
- **YAML frontmatter**: Optional metadata support
- **Content analysis**: Word counts, modification dates

### Link Resolution
- Exact filename matching
- Case-insensitive fallbacks
- Partial name matching
- Relative path resolution
- Broken link detection

## üîß Example Output

## üöÄ Advanced LLM Usage Tips

### For Claude Code Specifically:
1. **Always start with `overview`** - gives you the complete knowledge base structure
2. **Use `search` before `read`** - find the most relevant notes first
3. **Leverage `related`** - discover connections you might miss
4. **Use `trace`** - understand how ideas evolved or connect
5. **Check `cache stats`** - ensure you're working with fresh data

### Sample Claude Code Session:
```
User: "Help me find information about my machine learning projects"

Claude: I'll explore your knowledge base to find ML-related content.

brain --notes-root ~/vault overview
brain --notes-root ~/vault search "machine learning"
brain --notes-root ~/vault related [most-relevant-result]

Based on your knowledge base, I found several ML projects. Let me read the main one:

brain --notes-root ~/vault read projects/ml-classifier.md

Now I can see this connects to your data processing notes. Let me trace that connection:

brain --notes-root ~/vault trace projects/ml-classifier.md data/preprocessing.md
```
