# Brain - Knowledge Graph Integration for LLM Agents

Brain provides LLM agents with intelligent, contextual access to your markdown knowledge base. Instead of manually searching files, agents can understand your knowledge graph and autonomously decide when and how to access relevant information based on conversation context.

## üß† How It Works

Brain creates a **persistent knowledge graph** that LLM agents can query intelligently:

1. **üìä Graph Awareness**: Agent understands your entire knowledge structure - topics, connections, clusters
2. **üéØ Context-Driven Access**: Agent automatically searches your notes when queries are relevant to your knowledge base  
3. **üîç Smart Search**: Multi-strategy search finds exactly what's needed without overwhelming context
4. **üîó Relationship Navigation**: Agent can trace connections and discover related concepts

## üöÄ Setup for Claude Code

### 1. Install Brain
```bash
npm install -g brain
```

### 2. Initialize Your Knowledge Graph
```bash
# Run once to build your knowledge graph
brain --notes-root ~/vault overview
```

### 3. Configure Claude Code (Optional)
Create `CLAUDE.md` in your project to tell Claude about your notes:

```markdown
# Knowledge Base Integration

My personal notes are stored at `~/vault` and indexed with Brain.

Claude should automatically search my notes when:
- I ask about topics I've researched or written about
- I need context from previous projects or ideas  
- I reference concepts that might be in my knowledge base
- I ask "what do I know about X?" or similar

To access my knowledge base, use:
`brain --notes-root ~/vault [command]`

Key commands:
- `overview` - Get knowledge base structure
- `search "query"` - Find relevant notes
- `read note.md` - Read specific note with context
- `related note.md` - Find connected notes
```

## üí≠ Agent Behavior Examples

### Intelligent Context Detection

**User**: *"I'm working on a React project and need to handle authentication"*

**Claude's Decision Process**:
- User mentions "React project" and "authentication" 
- These are technical topics likely documented in notes
- ‚Üí Automatically search: `brain --notes-root ~/vault search "react authentication"`
- Find relevant notes and incorporate into response

**User**: *"What's the weather like today?"*

**Claude's Decision Process**:
- Weather query unrelated to personal knowledge base
- ‚Üí Skip Brain search, respond normally

### Proactive Knowledge Integration

**User**: *"Help me plan my weekend"*

**Claude's Decision Process**:
- Personal planning might reference previous ideas/projects
- ‚Üí Search: `brain --notes-root ~/vault search "weekend projects ideas"`
- ‚Üí If found, incorporate personal context: "I see you have some project ideas..."

## üéØ Key Commands for LLM Agents

### Essential Navigation
```bash
# Get complete knowledge base overview - START HERE
brain --notes-root ~/notes overview

# Search across all content, filenames, tags
brain --notes-root ~/notes search "your query"

# Read specific note with full context and connections
brain --notes-root ~/notes read note-name.md

# List notes in directory structure
brain --notes-root ~/notes ls [optional-path]
```

### Advanced Discovery
```bash
# Find related notes (direct links, clusters, similar topics)
brain --notes-root ~/notes related note-name.md

# Trace connection paths between any two notes
brain --notes-root ~/notes trace source.md target.md

# Pattern-based file finding
brain --notes-root ~/notes glob "**/*pattern*.md"

# Regex content search
brain --notes-root ~/notes grep "regex-pattern"
```

- **üîó Dual Organization**: Understands both hierarchical folders and graph-based wiki-style links
- **üîç Multi-Strategy Search**: Text content, filenames, tags, and graph navigation
- **ü§ñ LLM-Optimized**: Dense, structured output designed for efficient token usage
- **üìä Graph Analysis**: Detects hubs, clusters, orphaned notes, and connection paths
- **‚ö° High Performance**: Handles 1000+ notes with intelligent caching
- **üîÑ Live Updates**: Incremental updates when files change

## ü§ñ Agent Decision Framework

LLM agents should use Brain when the user query suggests personal knowledge relevance:

### ‚úÖ **Search My Notes When**:
- Technical questions about tools/frameworks I use
- References to "my projects", "my ideas", "what I know"
- Planning questions that might reference past work
- Creative tasks that could build on documented concepts
- Research topics I might have explored
- Problem-solving for domains I work in

### ‚ùå **Skip Brain When**:
- General knowledge questions 
- Current events or real-time information
- Simple calculations or basic concepts
- Weather, news, or external services
- Questions clearly outside my documented interests

## üîß Core Agent Commands

### Graph Intelligence
```bash
# Understand the knowledge landscape first
brain --notes-root ~/vault overview

# Get high-level structure and key topics
brain --notes-root ~/vault stats
```

### Context-Driven Search
```bash
# Search when user mentions specific topics
brain --notes-root ~/vault search "user mentioned topic"

# Find project-specific information
brain --notes-root ~/vault search "project name OR domain"

# Look for related concepts
brain --notes-root ~/vault search "broader topic category"
```

### Deep Context Retrieval
```bash
# Read specific notes that match the query
brain --notes-root ~/vault read [relevant-note.md]

# Find related information to provide fuller context
brain --notes-root ~/vault related [relevant-note.md]

# Trace connections between concepts
brain --notes-root ~/vault trace [concept-a.md] [concept-b.md]
```

## üéØ Smart Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Contextual Enhancement
```
User asks about React hooks
‚Üí brain search "react hooks"
‚Üí If found: "Based on your notes about React hooks..."
‚Üí If not found: Standard response without personal context
```

### Pattern 2: Project Continuity  
```
User mentions working on a project
‚Üí brain search "[project indicators]"
‚Üí Surface relevant past work, notes, decisions
‚Üí Provide continuity with previous thinking
```

### Pattern 3: Knowledge Building
```
User asks about unfamiliar topic
‚Üí brain search "[topic]" 
‚Üí Check if they've researched this before
‚Üí Either build on existing knowledge or note it's new territory
```

## üîß Cache Management

Brain uses intelligent caching for performance. LLM agents should know:

```bash
# Check cache status
brain --notes-root ~/notes cache stats

# Rebuild if notes have changed significantly
brain --notes-root ~/notes cache rebuild

# Clear cache if having issues
brain --notes-root ~/notes cache clear
```

## üìù Supported Markdown

### Link Types
- **Wiki links**: `[[note-name]]` or `[[note-name|display text]]`
- **Markdown links**: `[display text](relative/path/to/note.md)`
- **Tags**: `#tag-name` anywhere in the document

### Document Structure
- **Headings**: All levels (`#` to `######`) for hierarchy
- **YAML frontmatter**: Optional metadata support
- **Content analysis**: Word counts, modification dates

### Link Resolution
- Exact filename matching
- Case-insensitive fallbacks

## üéØ Real-World Agent Integration

### Autonomous Knowledge Integration
The agent should seamlessly weave your personal knowledge into conversations:

```
User: "I want to build a web scraper for product prices"

Claude Internal Process:
1. Detects technical/project query ‚Üí triggers brain search
2. brain --notes-root ~/vault search "web scraping python automation"
3. Finds relevant notes, incorporates personal context
4. Responds with both general advice AND your specific tools/approaches

Claude Response: "For web scraping, I'd recommend using Python with BeautifulSoup or Scrapy. 

I see from your notes that you've worked with web scraping before for your 'price-tracker' project, where you used Playwright for dynamic content. You also documented some rate limiting strategies that worked well. 

Let me check what specific challenges you encountered..."
```

### Smart Context Loading
Agent loads just enough context without overwhelming the conversation:

```
User: "How should I structure my React components?"

Claude Process:
1. brain search "react components architecture"
2. If found: Load your specific patterns and preferences
3. Blend personal knowledge with general best practices
4. Reference your actual project decisions

Result: Advice tailored to YOUR coding style and previous decisions
```

### Proactive Knowledge Surfacing
Agent can surface relevant knowledge even when not directly asked:

```
User: "I'm feeling stuck on this authentication flow"

Claude Process:
1. Recognizes problem-solving context
2. brain search "authentication security oauth"
3. Finds your previous auth implementations
4. Suggests approaches you've used successfully before

Result: "I notice you've solved similar auth challenges before. In your 'user-management' notes, you documented a clean JWT approach that handled refresh tokens elegantly..."
```
